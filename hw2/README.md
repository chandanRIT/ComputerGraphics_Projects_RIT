## Polygon Fill using the rasterization

	 * Draw a filled polygon in the SimpleCanvas.
	 
	 * The polygon has n distinct vertices. The coordinates of the vertices making up the polygon are stored in the 
	 * x and y arrays.  The ith vertex will have coordinate  (x[i], y[i]) 
	 
	 * You are to add the implementation here using only calls to SimpleCanvas.setPixel()
